# Import user events from Cloud Storage tutorial

## Introduction

The Retail API lets you import your user event data from Cloud Storage. All you need to do is provide a name of
the JSON file in the Cloud Storage bucket.

This type of import is useful when you need to import a large number of user events to your catalog in a single step.

For more information about different import types, their restrictions, and use cases, see the [Retail API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/import-user-events).

## Get started with Google Cloud Retail

This step is required if this is the first Retail API tutorial you run.
Otherwise, you can skip it.

### Select your project and enable the Retail API

Google Cloud organizes resources into projects. This lets you
collect all the related resources for a single application in one place.

If you don't have a Google Cloud project yet or you're not the owner of an existing one, you can
[create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).

After the project is created, set your PROJECT_ID to a ```project``` variable.
1. Run the following command in Terminal:
    ```bash
    gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    ```

1. Check that the Retail API is enabled for your project in the [Admin Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/retail/).

### Set up authentication

To run a code sample from the Cloud Shell, you need to be authenticated using the service account credentials.

1. Login with your user credentials.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```

1. Type `Y` and press **Enter**. Click the link in Terminal. A browser window should appear asking you to log in using your Gmail account.

1. Provide the Google Auth Library with access to your credentials and paste the code from the browser to the Terminal.

1. Upload your service account key JSON file and use it to activate the service account:

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json --iam-account <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
    ```

    ```bash
    gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file  ~/key.json
    ```

1. Set key as the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to be used for requesting the Retail API:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/key.json
    ```

**Note**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box to paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal and run it.

### Set the PROJECT_NUMBER and PROJECT_ID environment variables

Because you are going to run the code samples in your own Google Cloud project, you should specify the **project_number** and **project_id** as environment variables. It will be used in every request to the Retail API.

1. Find the project number and project ID in the Project Info card displayed on **Home/Dashboard**.

1. Set **project_number** with the following command:
    ```bash
    export PROJECT_NUMBER=<YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER>
    ```
1. Set **project_id** with the following command:
    ```bash
    export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    ```


### Install Google Cloud Retail libraries

1. Next, install Google packages:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Google.Cloud.Retail.V2
    dotnet add package Google.Cloud.Storage.V1

    ```

## Clone the Retail code samples

This step is required if this is the first Retail API tutorial you run.
Otherwise, you can skip it.

Clone the Git repository with all the code samples to learn the Retail features and check them in action.

1. Run the following command in the Terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dotnet-docs-samples.git
    ```

    The code samples for each of the Retail services are stored in different directories.

1. Go to the ```interactive-tutorial``` directory. This is our starting point to run more commands.
    ```bash
    cd retail/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples
    ```

## Upload catalog data to Cloud Storage

There is a <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/resources/user_events.json" regex="id">resources/user_events.json</walkthrough-editor-select-regex> file with valid user events prepared in the `resources` directory.

The other file, <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/resources/user_events_some_invalid.json" regex="id">resources/user_events_some_invalid.json</walkthrough-editor-select-regex>, contains both valid and invalid user events. You will use it to check the error handling.

In your own project you should create a Cloud Storage bucket and put the JSON file there.
The bucket name must be unique. For convenience, you can name it `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>_<TIMESTAMP>`.

1. To create the bucket and upload the JSON file, run the following command in the Terminal:
    ```bash
    dotnet run -- EventsCreateGcsBucket
    ```
1. Now you can see the bucket is created in the [Cloud Storage](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser), and the file is uploaded. The name of the created Cloud Storage bucket is printed in the Terminal.

1. Copy the name and set it as the environment variable `EVENTS_BUCKET_NAME`:
    ```bash
    export EVENTS_BUCKET_NAME=<YOUR_EVENTS_BUCKET_NAME>
    ```

## Import user events to the Retail catalog from the Cloud Storage source

1. To check the example of an import user events request, open <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/ImportUserEventsGcsSample.cs" regex="# call the Retail API to import user events">RetailEvents.Samples/ImportUserEventsGcsSample.cs</walkthrough-editor-select-regex>.

    The `Parent` field in the `ImportUserEventsRequest` method contains a catalog name along with a branch number you are going to import your user events to.

    If you are using user events prepared for these tutorials from the <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath=cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/resources/user_events.json" regex="id">resources/user_events.json</walkthrough-editor-select-regex> file, you can use the default branch to import user events to. However, if you are using custom user events, change the default_branch, which is `0`, to another branch ID, for example `1`.

    The `InputConfig` field defines the `GcsSource` as an import source.

1. To perform the user events import, open Terminal and run the command:
    ```bash
   dotnet run -- ImportUserEventsGcsTutorial
    ```

## Response analysis

After you call the import user events method from the Retail API, the import operation starts.

Importing can take a lot of time depending on the size of the user events set in your Cloud Storage.

The operation is completed when the field `Operation.Done()` is set to true.

1. Check the result. One of the following fields should be present:
    - `Error`, if the operation failed.
    - `Result`, if the operation was successful.

    You have imported valid user event objects into the catalog.

1. Check the `gcs_operation.metadata.success_count` field to get the total number of successfully imported user events. The number of failures during the user events import is returned in the `gcs_operation.metadata.failure_count` field.

1. Check the results printed out in the Terminal:
    ```terminal
    errorsConfig {
      gcsPrefix: "gs://import_user_events/error"
    }
    importSummary {
      joined_events_count: 4
    }
    ```

## Errors appeared during the importing

Try to import some invalid user events objects and check the error message in the operation response.

**Note**: The operation in this example generates an error message, but finishes successfully.

The `type` field is required and should have one of the [defined values](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/user-events#types), so if you set some invalid value, you get the invalid user event objects.

There is a <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/resources/user_events_some_invalid.json" regex="id">resources/user_events_some_invalid.json</walkthrough-editor-select-regex> file in the Cloud Storage bucket that contains some invalid user events.

1. Open the <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/ImportUserEventsGcsSample.cs" regex="# TO CHECK ERROR HANDLING USE THE JSON WITH INVALID USER EVENT">code sample</walkthrough-editor-select-regex> and assign the `GcsEventsObject` value to the filename:
    ```
    GcsEventsObject = "user_events_some_invalid.json"
    ```

1. Run the code sample and wait until the operation is completed:
    ```bash
    dotnet run -- ImportUserEventsGcsTutorial
    ```

Next, check the operation printed out in the Terminal.

## Errors appeared during importing: output analysis

If the operation is completed successfully, the `Result` field will be displayed. Otherwise, an `error` field is displayed instead.

Check the operation printed out in the Terminal. The operation is considered **successful** and the `Operation<ImportUserEventsResponse, ImportMetadata>.Metadata.SuccessCount` field contains the number of successfully imported user events, which is `3`.

There are two invalid user events in the input JSON file, and the number of failures during the user events import in the `Operation<ImportUserEventsResponse, ImportMetadata>.Metadata.failure_count` field is `1`.

The `Operation.Result` field points to the errors bucket, where you can find a JSON file with all of the importing errors.

The error is the following:
```terminal
errors_config {
  gcsPrefix: "gs://import_user_events/error"
}
importSummary {
  joined_events_count: 3
}
```

## Errors appeared due to an invalid request

Next, send an invalid import request to check the error message.

1. Open the  <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailEvents.Samples/ImportUserEventsGcsSample.cs" regex="# TO CHECK ERROR HANDLING PASTE THE INVALID CATALOG NAME HERE">`GetImportUserEventsGcsRequest()`</walkthrough-editor-select-regex> method, and uncomment the line with the `default_catalog` local variable with an invalid catalog name.

1. Run the code again with the following command:
    ```bash
     dotnet run -- ImportUserEventsGcsTutorial
    ```
1. Check the error message in the Terminal:
    ```terminal
    google.api_core.exceptions.InvalidArgument: 400 Request contains an invalid argument.
    ```
