# Delete product tutorial

## Get started

To fill the catalog or to update a massive number of products, we recommend using the `import_products` method. However,
sometimes you might need to make some detached changes in your product catalog.

For such cases, the Retail API provides you with the following methods:
- CreateProduct
- GetProduct
- UpdateProduct
- DeleteProduct

In this tutorial you will call the `DeleteProduct()` method.

For information about managing catalog information, see the [Retail API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/manage-catalog).

## Get started with Google Cloud Retail

This step is required if this is the first Retail API Tutorial you run.
Otherwise, you can skip it.

### Select your project and enable the Retail API

Google Cloud organizes resources into projects. This lets you
collect all the related resources for a single application in one place.

If you don't have a Google Cloud project yet or you're not the owner of an existing one, you can
[create a new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).

After the project is created, set your PROJECT_ID to a ```project``` variable.
1. Run the following command in Terminal:
    ```bash
    gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    ```

1. Check that the Retail API is enabled for your project in the [Admin Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai/retail/).

### Create service account

To access the Retail API you must create a service account.

1. To create service account follow this [instruction](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/setting-up#service-account)

1. Find your service account on the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam),
   click `Edit` icon and add the roles 'Storage Admin' and 'BigQuery Admin. It may take a while for the changes to take effect.

1. Copy the service account email in the field Principal.

### Set up authentication

To run a code sample from the Cloud Shell, you need to be authenticated using the service account credentials.

1. Login with your user credentials.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```

1. Type `Y` and press **Enter**. Click the link in Terminal. A browser window should appear asking you to log in using your Gmail account.

1. Provide the Google Auth Library with access to your credentials and paste the code from the browser to the Terminal.

1. Upload your service account key JSON file and use it to activate the service account:

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/key.json --iam-account <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
    ```

    ```bash
    gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file  ~/key.json
    ```

1. Set key as the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to be used for requesting the Retail API:
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/key.json
    ```

**Note**: Click the copy button on the side of the code box to paste the command in the Cloud Shell terminal and run it.

### Set the PROJECT_NUMBER and PROJECT_ID environment variables

Because you are going to run the code samples in your own Google Cloud project, you should specify the **project_number** and **project_id** as environment variables. It will be used in every request to the Retail API.

1. Find the project number and project ID in the Project Info card displayed on **Home/Dashboard**.

1. Set **project_number** with the following command:
    ```bash
    export PROJECT_NUMBER=<YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER>
    ```
1. Set **project_id** with the following command:
    ```bash
    export PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
    ```

### Install Google Cloud Retail libraries

To run .NET code samples for the Retail API tutorial, you need to set up your virtual environment.

1. Next, install Google packages:
    ```bash
    dotnet add package Google.Cloud.Retail.V2

    ```

## Clone the Retail code samples

This step is required if this is the first Retail API Tutorial you run.
Otherwise, you can skip it.

Clone the Git repository with all the code samples to learn the Retail features and check them in action.

<!-- TODO(ianan): change the repository link -->
1. Run the following command in the Terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dotnet-docs-samples.git
    ```

    The code samples for each of the Retail services are stored in different directories.

1. Go to the ```interactive-tutorial``` directory. This is our starting point to run more commands.
    ```bash
    cd retail/interactive-tutorial/RetailProduct.Samples
    ```

## Delete product

To build `DeleteProductRequest`, only the `name` field is required.

You should use the full resource name of a product, such as:
```
projects/<project_number>/locations/global/catalogs/<catalog_id>/branches/<branch_id>/products/<product_id>
```

1. Open the `DeleteProductRequest` example in <walkthrough-editor-select-regex filePath="cloudshell_open/interactive-tutorial/RetailProducts.Samples/DeleteProductSample.cs" regex="# get delete product request">DeleteProductSample.cs</walkthrough-editor-select-regex>.

1. Run the code sample in the Terminal to create a product in a catalog and remove it using a prepared request:
    ```bash
    dotnet run -- DeleteProductTutorial
    ```

If the product was successfully removed you should see the following error message.

    ```terminal
    google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound: 404 Product with name "projects/<project_number>/locations/global/catalogs/<catalog_id>/branches/<branch_id>/products/<product_id>" does not exist.
    ```

## Congratulations

You have completed the tutorial! We encourage you to test the deleting products by yourself.
